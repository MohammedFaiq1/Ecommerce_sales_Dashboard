# Summary
In this project, we concentrated on four key performance indicators: YTD Sales, YTD Profit, YTD Profit Margin, and Quantity of Products Sold. We performed an in-depth analysis of sales data across various categories, including product types, states, and regions, to gain a comprehensive understanding of performance and distribution trends. To effectively communicate these insights, we leveraged interactive dashboards, charts, and visualizations. Our ultimate aim was to use the valuable insights gained from this project to make informed business decisions, drive growth, and optimize operational strategies for the benefit of the e-commerce sales company.
